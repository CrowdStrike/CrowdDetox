BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Pre-built versions of the plugin for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (hexrays_CrowdDetox.plw, hexrays_CrowdDetox.pmc, and hexrays_CrowdDetox.plx, respectively) can be downloaded from http://www.crowdstrike.com/community-tools/index.html

If you would like to use the pre-built plugin, you may skip to INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS. Otherwise, follow the steps below to build the CrowdDetox plugin.

1. Install IDA Pro with Hex-Rays (https://www.hex-rays.com)
2. Download and extract the IDA Pro SDK (https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml)
3. Install CMake (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
4. Install a C++ compiler
5. Run CMake on the included CMakeLists.txt file with the following command line arguments: -D IDA_DIR=<path to IDA Pro installation> -D IDA_SDK=<path to IDA Pro SDK>

   For example, if you want to build the CrowdDetox plugin with Visual Studio 11 in Windows, your command line may look as follows:
   cmake.exe -G "Visual Studio 11" -D CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" -D IDA_DIR="C:\Program Files\IDA 6.4" -D IDA_SDK="C:\idasdk64" CMakeLists.txt

6. Build the solution using a C++ compiler. If using Visual Studio in Windows, open the created CrowdDetox.sln solution and build the CrowdDetox project. In Mac OS or Linux, run make.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Copy hexrays_CrowdDetox.plw (for Windows), hexrays_CrowdDetox.pmc (for Mac OS), or hexrays_CrowdDetox.plx (for Linux) to the IDA Pro plugins folder.


UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Remove hexrays_CrowdDetox.plw (for Windows), hexrays_CrowdDetox.pmc (for Mac OS), or hexrays_CrowdDetox.plx (for Linux) from the IDA Pro plugins folder.


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

To detox a function's decompilation, press 'Shift-F5'.

By default, CrowdDetox considers values and variables used in return statements to be legitimate. Users can manually set a function's prototype to specify a return type of 'void' if the user doesn't want CrowdDetox to consider a function's returned variables to automatically be considered legitimate.
